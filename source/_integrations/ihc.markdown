IHC Controller integration for Home Assistant allows you to connect the LK IHC controller to Home Assistant. The controller is sold under other names in different countries - "ELKO Living system" in Sweden and Norway.

## Setup using configuration.yaml

Setup using the `configuration.yaml` file is no longer supported.
If you have existing manual configuration in the `configuration.yaml` file,
see below how to [Migrate manual setup](#migrating-manual-setup).

## Setup using the Home Assistant UI

Setup the IHC integration for your installation via Configuration >> Integrations in the UI,
 click the button with + sign and from the list of integrations select IHC.
You must enter the url for your IHC Controller, the username and password.
Auto setup is enabled by default (see auto setup below).
You can uncheck it if you want to manually add all your IHC products.

The IHC integrations has an options dialog where your can set the "info" option.
When the "info" option is enabled the attributes IHC "name", "note" and "position" will be added to each component.
This will make it easier to identify the IHC products within Home Assistant.
If you have multiple controllers an additional controller id attribute is added.

## Auto setup of IHC products

If the auto setup is enabled, the `ihc` integration will automatically find IHC products and insert these as devices in Home Assistant.
See the individual device types for a list of IHC products to be recognized automatically.

Entities will get a default name that is a combination of the IHC group and IHC resource id.

## Manual setup

Each entity is associated with an IHC resource id. To manually setup entities you specify resource ids from the IHC project.
The IHC project is the file you edit/upload to the IHC Controller using LK IHC Visual - or similar program if your controller is not the LK brand.

The project file is an XML file (.vis extension) and you can view it with any text/XML editor.
You can rename it to have the XML extension and use a browser like Chrome or Internet Explorer.
The resources are the \<airlink_xxx> or \<dataline_xxx> elements.
Shown as inputs or outputs of products in the IHC application.
You can also use inputs and outputs from function blocks.
These are the \<resource_input> and \<resource_output> elements from the project file.

The IHC resource id should be specified as an integer value. In the project file the id will be specified as a hex number.

In the newer versions of the IHC Visual application, you can see the resource id by holding down Ctrl+Shift while you hover the resource.
If you want an easier way to get the IHC resource ids, you can download the [Alternative Service View application](https://www.dingus.dk/updated-ihc-alternative-service-view/). The application will show the product tree. You can expand it, select inputs and outputs and when selected you can see the resource id.

The manual configuration must be placed in a `ihc_manual_setup.yaml` file located in the Home Assistant configuration folder.

```yaml
# Example ihc_manual_setup.yaml entry
ihc:
  - xx1:
    binary_sensor:
      - id: 12345
        name: switch_front_door
      ...
    light:
      - id: 12345
        name: tablelight
  - xx2:
      ...
```

xx1 and xx2 is the controller id.
The controller id is the serial number of your IHC controller.
The IHC controller device in Home Assistant will have a default name set to the controller id.
(If you have changed the name, you can also find the controller serial number in the IHC administrator application.)

See the manual setup of each device type for configuration options.

## Binary Sensor

When auto setup is enabled the following products will be found in the IHC project and setup as binary sensors:

- Dataline magnet contacts
- Dataline Pir sensors
- Dataline Pir sensors with twilight detection
- Dataline Pir alarm sensor
- Dataline smoke detector
- Dataline gas detector
- Dataline light sensor

### Manual configuration of binary sensors

## Migrating manual setup

If an old IHC configuration is present in the `configuration.yaml` file,
and it contains manual setup, the content will automatically be copied and converted to the
`ihc_manual_setup.yaml` file located in the Home Assistant configuration folder.
If the `ihc_manual_setup.yaml` already exists the migration is skipped.
The new `ihc_manual_setup.yaml` will automatically be setup with the IHC controller id.
The controller id is the IHC controller serial number.
To get the serial number your existing setup must be able to connect to the IHC controller.

When the setup has been migrated you can check the `ihc_manual_setup.yaml` file.
If it looks ok, then delete your current ihc section in the `configuration.yaml` file,
restart Home Assistant, and add the IHC controller through the UI.
